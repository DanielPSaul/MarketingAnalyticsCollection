**Description:** This repository holds a collection of multiple assignments and projects I completed for a Marketing Analytics and Prediction course I took at UGA. Most of our work was done using the statistical software SPSS and data vizualization software Tableau. There is a mix of casino, retail, and online shopping analysis. Additionally, I performed a decent amount of machine learning with marketing data; specifically using decision trees, RFM, multiple linear regression, and logistic regression.
